## Data Source Note
Due to limitations of free real-time Hong Kong stock market APIs, this demo uses sophisticated market simulation that:
- Generates realistic price movements based on historical volatility patterns
- Updates hourly with new data
- Maintains consistent technical indicators (RSI, Moving Averages)
- Simulates market trends and volatility

For production deployment with real data, integration with paid APIs like Bloomberg, Reuters, or HKEX datafeed would be required.
